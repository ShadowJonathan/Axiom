# `axiom`

A minimal Matrix Homeserver implementation for testing and prototyping.

It's objective is to provide a codebase that is easy for developers to fork and iterate prototyping

It is not intended to be a heavily-used or stable homeserver implementation, the focus is an easy gate into a matrix feature, stability and master-branch compatibility with the matrix spec and ecosystem comes second.
